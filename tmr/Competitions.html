		SAE International, initially established as the Society of Automotive Engineers, is a U.S.-based,

		globally active professional association and standards developing

		organization for engineering professionals in various industries. Principal emphasis is placed

		on transport industries such as automotive, aerospace, and commercial vehicles.

		SAE International has more than 127,000 members globally. Membership is granted to individuals,

		not through companies. Aside from its standardization efforts, SAE International also devotes

		resources to projects and programs in STEM education, professional certification, and collegiate

		design competitions.

		<br /><br /><strong>BAJA SAE</strong><br />

		Baja SAE is an intercollegiate design competition run by the Society of Automotive

		Engineers (SAE). Teams of students from universities all over the world design and build small off-

		road cars. All The cars have unmodified Briggs &amp; Stratton. The goal in Baja SAE racing is to design,

		build and race off-road vehicles that can withstand the harshest elements of rough terrain.  Baja SAE

		events are held across the US and around the world where events are held including India, China,

		Brazil, South Africa and Korea.

		The final placement of the teams depend upon static events, dynamic events

		and an endurance race. Static events, such as written reports, presentations and design evaluations

		are provided by participating teams. This is when the teams are judged on ergonomics, functionality,

		and producibility of their cars. There are multiple dynamic events, usually four per event, as well as a

		single four-hour endurance race. The dynamic events include hill climbs, sled pulls, maneuverability

		events, rock crawls, and suspension &amp; traction events.



		<br /><br /><strong>ESI</strong><br />

		Enduro Student India is an exclusive student design competition which has been conceived and conducted

		exclusively by Delta Inc. Enduro Student India and logos are exclusive trademarks wholly owned by Delta Inc. The

		competition focuses on safety, good engineering practice, engineering design, education and creating opportunity for

		participating students. Delta Inc declares that the events conducted under the brand name Baja Student India™ are

		exclusive events and the participants/sponsors shall not associate the events conducted by Delta Inc as event

		classified by SAE International® and/or SAEINDIA®.
